## Memory System Awareness

This workspace uses a layered memory system. Understand the layers before acting:

| Layer      | Location         | Purpose                                                         |
| ---------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| onboarding | `onboarding/`    | Code commentary — logic, invariants, conventions, task tracking |
| docs       | `docs/`          | Authoritative reference documentation                           |
| sources    | `docs/sources/`  | References to external technical documentation, mcps, etc.      |
| glossary   | `docs/glossary/` | Canonical vocabulary and cross-repo index                       |
| tasks      | `tasks/`         | Current change intent, plans, decision logs                     |

## Onboarding Usage

When working with code make sure to read the corresponding onboarding file alongside it. The code path tells the agent where to find the onboarding, and the onboarding file name matches the code file name.

For example, if you are working with `src/js/libs/device_connection/apiRequests.ts`, read `onboarding/device-management/helpdesk/src/js/libs/device_connection/apiRequests.md` for the relevant commentary.
Note that onboarding repositories may be segmented by domain (e.g., `helpdesk`) to group related files.

## heavy-task-workflow

Operational references:

1. `skills/**`
2. `skills/W-01-heavy-task-workflow/workflow/**`

### Process Guard Rails

1.  Use live skills and workflow docs as the operating spec for phase order, artifact names, ownership, and checkpoint gates.
2.  Start from the live repo state and the current task. Change only what the task and workflow require.
3.  Preserve existing behavior, helper structure, and compatible guidance unless the task or workflow explicitly changes, relocates, or retires them.
4.  For `changed-in-place` and `moved` surfaces, implement the required delta. Do not collapse surviving content to the projected slice.
5.  Planning is scheduling-only. Do not introduce new design or contract content there.
6.  Implementation is sequential by default. Record issues first; do not silently promote them into requirement or architecture changes.
7.  Checkpoint reviews are review-only. They assess artifacts and findings; they do not rewrite working artifacts or approvals.

### Workflow Development Guard Rails

Workflow design reference when changing the workflow itself: [onboarding/heavy-task-workflow/overview.md](onboarding/heavy-task-workflow/overview.md)

1. Use onboarding docs when developing or changing the workflow itself, not as the primary operational source for normal coding tasks.
2. Keep separation of concerns: `SKILL.md` owns entrypoint guidance, workflow docs own phase behavior, templates own scaffolds, and validation or check assets own verification.

## No Code Changes Before Explicit Developer Approval

When asked to find a sollution to a problem, do not change any code before you have explained your sollution in chat with code examples for all distinct changes you intend to make.
**Then wait for developer approval before touching any code!**

## Chat Based Coding Workflow

1. When planning code changes against onboarding documentation, invoke `C-02-onboarding-drift-detection` to find all drifted onboardings for the files in question. Do not plan against drifted or missing-verification onboarding until the drift report has been handed off to `C-05-create-or-update-onboarding-files` or the caller has explicitly accepted directional-only trust.

2. Then once you have planned the changes show them to the developer in chat including code examples for every distinct change you intend to make. Wait for explicit developer approval before you start changing any code.

3. After approval apply the code changes, create or update the onboarding documentation, and use the appropriate code quality checks from `docs/tools.md`.
