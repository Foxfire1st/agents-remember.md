## Purpose

<What this source file is responsible for and why it matters.>

## Code Commentary

### Logic

<What the code does. Key functions or methods, data flow, notable branching, and the parts that are easiest to misunderstand.>

### Conventions

<Patterns, naming conventions, or local style choices specific to this file or area.>

### Todos

<Known issues or technical debt that are not tied to one active task file.>

### Docs References

<Start with a short prose summary if there is meaningful documentation context to explain, then add the citation table. Use `<AR_MANAGEMENT_ROOT>/system/sources.md` only to decide which documentation to read; never cite the registry itself. Cite the actual library documentation, canonical local mirror, or source artifact that directly proves the statement. Read local mirrors if needed, but link the table row to the canonical online document reference. Investigate and preserve useful explanation already present in this section; correct it if needed rather than deleting it. If nothing relevant exists, keep the table and record what was checked plus `No relevant documentation found.`>

## Invariants And Boundaries

<Rules that must continue to hold, ownership boundaries, sequencing constraints, and what this file should not do.>

## Cross-Repo References

<Start with a short prose summary if there is meaningful cross-repo or external-boundary behavior to explain, then add the citation table. Use `<AR_MANAGEMENT_ROOT>/system/sources.md` only to choose evidence sources; never cite the registry itself. Cite the actual code, onboarding evidence, documentation mirror, generated artifact, or sibling-repo file that directly proves the statement. Use workspace-relative links for code or onboarding evidence; never absolute filesystem paths. Investigate and preserve useful explanation already present in this section; correct it if needed rather than deleting it. If nothing relevant exists, keep the table and record what was checked plus `No meaningful cross-repo references found.`>
