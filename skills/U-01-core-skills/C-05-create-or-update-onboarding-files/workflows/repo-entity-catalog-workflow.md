# Repo Entity Catalog Workflow

Use this workflow when creating or maintaining a repo-level entity catalog at `<onboarding-root>/<repo>/entities.md`.

Template: `../templates/repo-entity-catalog-template.md`

## Goal

Create or update one repo-level entity catalog documenting load-bearing real entities and their cross-layer projections.

## Scope

1. exactly one entity catalog per repo
2. focus on load-bearing real entities that recur across layers and cause review, migration, or naming confusion
3. do not use the file as a glossary or an exhaustive ontology of every noun in the repo

## Source Discovery Rules

1. Start by reading `<AR_MANAGEMENT_ROOT>/system/sources.md` and use its `Domain Documentation` category for the repo entities under review.
2. Use the `Domain Documentation` sources from `<AR_MANAGEMENT_ROOT>/system/sources.md` when deciding canonical source of truth, naming drift, and cross-layer projections.
3. Do not rely on adjacent onboarding alone when the `Domain Documentation` category contains more authoritative domain, protocol, or architecture context.
4. If `Domain Documentation` includes both local and live variants, use the local material first for direct access and evidence gathering, but link onboarding output to the canonical online reference rather than the local mirror.
5. `<AR_MANAGEMENT_ROOT>/system/sources.md` is a discovery index only. Do not cite it as evidence; cite the actual documentation, code, generated artifact, or sibling-repo source that proves each entity claim.

## Placement Rules

```text
<onboarding-root>/
  <repo>/
    overview.md
    entities.md
```

1. The file lives directly under the repo onboarding folder.
2. It complements `overview.md`; it does not replace it.

## Metadata Rules

1. `lastUpdated`: use `mcp_time_get_current_time` in `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm` format.
2. `status`: use `draft` while the structure is still evolving and `active` once it is stable enough for routine reuse.

## Entity Entry Rules

1. Use canonical entity names as section headings.
2. Prefer the real entity over a drifted UI or storage label.
3. Record current naming drift instead of creating duplicate entries for synonyms.
4. State the current canonical source of truth when it is knowable.
5. Use layer comparisons to show how the same entity appears across systems.

## Recommended Entry Criteria

Add an entity when at least one is true:

1. the same real thing appears under multiple names across layers
2. the entity is central to a current migration or refactor
3. developers regularly confuse it with a nearby entity
4. the entity is important in cross-repo tracing

Avoid entries that are:

1. pure vocabulary with no stable entity behind it
2. very local implementation details with no cross-layer relevance
3. duplicates of an existing entry with only wording differences

## Create Workflow

1. confirm the repo does not already have an entity catalog
2. gather current time via MCP time tool
3. read `<AR_MANAGEMENT_ROOT>/system/sources.md`, then read the repo overview and the relevant materials from its `Domain Documentation` category needed to identify the first load-bearing entities; cite those actual materials, not the registry
4. fill the template from `../templates/repo-entity-catalog-template.md`
5. seed the catalog with the most confusion-prone entities first
6. add a lightweight pointer from the repo overview when it improves discoverability

## Maintain Workflow

1. re-read `<AR_MANAGEMENT_ROOT>/system/sources.md`, the current catalog, and the relevant source materials for the entity being updated; use the registry only to locate evidence
2. prefer updating an existing entry over creating a near-duplicate
3. update `lastUpdated` whenever the entity set or any existing entity meaningfully changes
4. keep the file selective; expand only when the extra entries materially improve understanding

## Review Heuristics

Before finalizing changes, check:

1. are the entities real and stable rather than just terms?
2. does each entry separate the entity from commonly confused neighbors?
3. is naming drift documented without becoming the new canonical label?
4. do the layer representations help a reviewer trace the same entity across systems?
