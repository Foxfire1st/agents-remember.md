## Code Structure

| Area   | Path                                         | Tech   | Purpose                             |

## Functional Areas

### <Area Name>

<Short, high-signal summary of the area and how it fits into the repo.>

## Cross-Repo References

<Start with prose that explains the important cross-repo or cross-boundary behavior in this repo. Then add the citation table to back that explanation up. Preserve and correct useful existing explanation rather than replacing it with the table. If nothing relevant exists, keep the table and record what was checked plus `No relevant cross-repo evidence found.`>

## Notes

- New overviews should use the canonical headings `## Cross-Repo References` and `## Docs References`.
- These sections are explanation-first surfaces backed by citation tables, not table-only replacements for narrative context.
- In `Cross-Repo References`, `Source Path` must be a workspace-relative link to the cited code or onboarding file.
- In `Docs References`, `Source Path` must be the canonical online document link, even if a local mirror was used for reading.
- `Citations` should use exact line ranges like `L10-L18` or `L10-L18; L42-L47`.
- `Finding` should be a concise summary of what the cited lines establish.
