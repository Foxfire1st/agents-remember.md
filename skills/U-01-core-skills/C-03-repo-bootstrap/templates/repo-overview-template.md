## Notes

- New overviews should use the canonical headings `## Cross-Repo References` and `## Docs References`.
- `Source Path` must be the clickable link to the cited file.
- `Citations` should use exact line ranges like `L10-L18` or `L10-L18; L42-L47`.
- `Finding` should be a concise summary of what the cited lines establish.
