# <Component> — Component Overview

> <One-sentence description of the component's role in the repo>

Use this template for `onboarding/<repo>/<component>/overview.md`.

## Architecture

```text
<ASCII diagram showing the component's internal structure and main dependencies>
```

## Responsibilities

<Describe what this component owns and what it deliberately does not own.>

## Key Flows

<Summarize the important runtime, data, or control flows within this component.>

## Patterns & Conventions

- <important local pattern>
- <important local convention>

## Invariants & Boundaries

- <load-bearing invariant>
- <ownership or sequencing boundary>

## Onboarding File Index

| Priority | Source File                          | Onboarding Path                                    | Why                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| high     | [<source-file>](path/to/source-file) | [<onboarding-file.md>](path/to/onboarding-file.md) | <why this file needs dedicated onboarding> |

## Cross-Repo References

<Start with prose that explains the important cross-repo or cross-boundary behavior in this component. Then add the citation table to back that explanation up. Preserve and correct useful existing explanation rather than replacing it with the table. If nothing relevant exists, keep the table and record what was checked plus `No relevant cross-repo evidence found.`>

## Docs References

<Start with prose that explains the documentation context that matters for this component. Then add the citation table to back that explanation up. Preserve and correct useful existing explanation rather than replacing it with the table. If nothing relevant exists, keep the table and record what was checked plus `No relevant documentation found.`>

## Tech Stack

- <language/framework>
- <supporting runtime or library>

## Needs Verification

- <Any unresolved or low-confidence findings that should not be stated as settled fact>

## Notes

- `Docs References` and `Cross-Repo References` are explanation-first sections backed by citation tables.
- In `Cross-Repo References`, `Source Path` must be a workspace-relative link to the cited code or onboarding file.
- In `Docs References`, `Source Path` must be the canonical online document link, even if a local mirror was used for reading.
- `Citations` should use exact line ranges like `L10-L18` or `L10-L18; L42-L47`.
- `Finding` should be a concise summary of what the cited lines establish.
