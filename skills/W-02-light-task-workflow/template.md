# Light Task Template

Use this template for any task file created by `W-02-light-task-workflow`.

Implementation sections use checkbox-based steps and checkbox substeps. The checklist is the live execution state during implementation and review.

## Usage Rules

1. Keep the section structure even for small tasks.
2. Use configured management-root paths such as `<task-root>/`, `<onboarding-root>/`, and `<AR_MANAGEMENT_ROOT>/docs/`.
3. When code changes are in scope, include proposed code examples for each distinct implementation change.
4. For documentation-only or other non-code tasks, keep the section and state that no code examples are needed.
5. Mark substeps complete before their parent verification item.
6. Add or reorder checklist items when scope changes, then get approval again if the change is significant.
7. Use the light-task status values: `planning`, `inProgress`, `Completed`.
8. Use `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM` anywhere the template records task-local dates or timestamps, including metadata, decision logs, progress notes, and review outcomes.
